* The C# extractor now accepts an extractor option `buildless`, which is used to decide what type of extraction that should be performed. If `true` then buildless (standalone) extraction will be performed. Otherwise tracing extraction will be performed (default).
The option is added via `codeql database create --language=csharp -Obuildless=true ...`.
